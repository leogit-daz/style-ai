# StyleAI Design System

This design system establishes the visual standards for StyleAI. It uses an editorial, fashion-focused aesthetic that feels premium, structured, and calm rather than playful or tech-larping.

## 🎨 Color Palette Specs

We avoid standard tech-blue gradients and neon highlights. The palette draws from organic earth tones, soft linen, and rich clay.

## ✒️ Typography System

StyleAI pairs premium display sans/serif headings or clean grotesque widths with functional technical monospace labels.

```
+-------------------------------------------------------+
|  StyleAI (Heading Displays)                           |

## 🎛️ Component Blueprints

### 1. Elevated Material Cards
* **Border Radii:** Rounded corners set exactly to `16dp` for large cards/overlays and `12dp` for inner item listings.
* **Elevation & Shadows:** Ultra-soft, high-diffusion shadows (`shadow-sm` or `shadow-md` equivalents). Never use dark, stark black outlines or thick boundaries.
* **Internal Margins:** High-density balanced padding (16dp-20dp padding) to ensure focus on content with generous negative space boundaries.

### 2. Actionable Buttons
* **Primary Clay Btn:** Fully rounded or `12dp` corner fills with background `#8D5B4C` and bold text tracking. Elevated hover states with subtle size scales in the browser web simulator.
* **Secondary Utility Btn:** Clean light grey borders (`border-slate-205`) with a transparent or white background. Fully desaturated text to preserve visual hierarchy.

### 3. Integrated Navigation
* **Placement:** Desktop-anchored bottom menu utilizing exactly five key tab segments:
  1. **Home:** Instant command center featuring quick analysis gates.
  2. **Wardrobe:** Visual physical closet overview showing items and custom passport evaluation sheets.
  3. **Decisions:** Chronological history matching log with skip/buy counters.
  4. **Looks:** Seamless visual Reference Board with simulated credit metrics.
